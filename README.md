 <b> Now we will create tickets as a user, and work through them as an agent to see how tickets work on the front and back end.</b>

 <p>
   
   First we need to create [tickets](http://localhost/osTicket/)  </p>

</p>
<br />

- Create your user, add their information and select your "Help Topic". Once you do that summarize your issue and then create your ticket.

 <b> The tickets are created now we can look into what it takes to solve each ticket. </b>
 
- Now log into osTicket as an agent and look over the tickets that you have created. Take notice of the priority and sender of each ticket.

 - If need be the admin could assign tickets to specific agents, or even change the priority level of the tickets.

</p>
 
- There is a thread created whevener you make a change to a ticket so that other agents can go back and see what you have done to solve the issue.

</p>
<br />
 
- Once you have successfully resolved the issue close the ticket by selecting "resolved" at the bottom where ticket status is located.
